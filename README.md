I developed a multi-threaded banking application to streamline various banking operations, including account management, balance inquiries, deposits, withdrawals, and transaction history tracking. The application commences with a parent process, guiding users to select a specific branch, and subsequently initiates a dedicated thread for concurrent processing.

The core functionality, encapsulated within the `displayMenu` function, allows users to perform essential operations seamlessly. Notably, I addressed the challenge of CSV file handling by strategically splitting the initial file into four branch-specific components, simplifying data management.

A significant accomplishment in the project is the successful implementation of session persistence, earning bonus points. This feature enhances user experience by allowing them to seamlessly resume from a previous session.

The project has been a valuable learning experience, requiring effective problem-solving, particularly in overcoming CSV file intricacies. Successfully addressing these challenges has significantly contributed to my understanding of real-world programming hurdles.

In conclusion, this multi-threaded banking application represents a practical application of theoretical knowledge, demonstrating the complexities and rewards inherent in software development. The project is available for exploration on GitHub, serving as a hands-on learning resource for developers and users alike.
